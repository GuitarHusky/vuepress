tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.

        I Have a Dream
      </a></h2> <p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the
greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today,
signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great
beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the
flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long
night of their captivity.

        The Purpose of Education
      </a></h2> <p>As I engage in the so-called &quot;bull sessions&quot; around and about the school, I too
often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of
education. Most of the &quot;brethren&quot; think that education should equip them with
the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the
masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends
rather than means to an end.

It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of

I may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the
beginning of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed
for the balance of the strange tale.

When my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much, and that I was
prone to doubtfulness, his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had
commenced, and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of m</p> <p>Published : 24 Jul, 12</p> <p><a href="/vuepress/out-to-sea.html">Read more</a></p></div><div><h2><a href="/vuepress/looking-glass-house.html"><div style="max-width:250px;"><img src="https://demo.ghost.io/content/images/2015/04/demo5.jpg" alt=""></div>

was the black kitten‚Äôs fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its
face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it
pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn‚Äôt have had any hand in the
mischief.

The way Dinah washed her children‚Äôs faces was this: first she held the poor

of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister
was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use
of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day

nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any
nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great
battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a
